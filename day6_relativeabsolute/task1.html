        Chess is a board game for two players. It is sometimes
        called international chess or Western chess to distinguish
        it from related games such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess).
        Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is
        played
        on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid.

    <p>Carrom is a tabletop game of Indian origin in which players flick discs, attempting to knock them to the corners
        of the board. In South Asia, many clubs and cafés hold regular tournaments. Carrom is commonly played by
        families, including children, and at social functions. Different standards and rules exist in different areas.

    <p>A card game is any game that uses playing cards as the primary device with which the game is played, whether the
        cards are of a traditional design or specifically created for the game (proprietary). Countless card games
        exist, including families of related games (such as poker). A small number of card games played with traditional
        decks have formally standardized rules with international tournaments being held, but most are folk games whose
        rules may vary by region, culture, location or from circle to circle.
        Traditional card games are played with a deck or pack of playing cards which are identical in size and shape.
        Each card has two sides, the face and the back. Normally the backs of the cards are indistinguishable. The faces
        of the cards may all be unique, or there can be duplicates. The composition of a deck is known to each player.
        In some cases several decks are shuffled together to form a single pack or shoe. Modern card games usually have
        bespoke decks, often with a vast amount of cards, and can include number or action cards. This type of game is
        generally regarded as part of the board game hobby.</p>

        Uno cards
        Uno (/ˈuːnoʊ/; from Spanish and Italian for 'one'), stylized as UNO, is a proprietary American shedding-type
        card game originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati, that housed
        International Games Inc., a gaming company acquired by Mattel on January 23, 1992.[3]

        Played with a specially printed deck, the game is derived from the crazy eights family of card games which, in
        turn, is based on the traditional German game of mau-mau.

        History
        The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. When his
        family and friends began to play more and more, he and his family mortgaged their home to raise $8,000 to have
        5,000 copies of the game made.[4] He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it
        as well. Robbins later sold the rights to Uno to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor
        owner in Joliet, Illinois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games,
        Inc., to market Uno, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of
        Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois.

    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of
        which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three
        stumps. Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket holding
        bats, with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the
        opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with
        the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the ball
        reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.</p>

        <h1>2.Gilli_Danda</h1>
    </i>
    <p>Gillidanda is played with two pieces of equipment – a danda, being a long wooden stick, and a gilli, a small
        oval-shaped piece of wood. It is played with four or more players of even numbers.
        The boy on left is about to strike the gilli with the danda, while the one on right is fielding.
        Standing in a small circle, the player balances the gilli on a stone in an inclined manner (somewhat like a
        see-saw) with one end of the gilli touching the ground while the other end is in the air. The player then uses
        the danda to hit the gilli at the raised end, which flips it into the air. While it is in the air, the player
        strikes the gilli, hitting it as far as possible. Having struck the gilli, the player is required to run and
        touch a pre-agreed point outside the circle before the gilli is retrieved by an opponent. There are no specific
        dimensions of gillidanda and it does not have a limited number of players.

        The gilli becomes airborne after it is struck. If a fielder from the opposing team catches the gilli, the
        striker is out. If the gilli lands on the ground, the fielder closest to the gilli has one chance to hit the
        danda (which has to be placed on top of the circle used) with a throw (similar to a run out in cricket). If the
        fielder is successful, the striker is out; if not, the striker scores one point and gets another opportunity to
        strike. The team (or individual) with the most points wins the game. If the striker fails to hit the gilli in
        three tries, the striker is out (similar to a strikeout in baseball). After the gilli has been struck, the
        opposing players need to return to the circle or, in the best case, catch it in mid-air without it hitting the
        ground – this was believed to have later evolved into a Catch Out in cricket and baseball.</p>

        <h1>3.Hockey</h1>
    </i>
    <div>Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports which
        originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. While these sports
        vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel, and playing surface, they share broad characteristics of
        two opposing teams using a stick to propel a ball or disk into a goal.

        There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled or bladed, while others do
        not. In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word hockey is often preceded by
        another word i.e. field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, rink hockey, or floor hockey.

        In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a
        type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. Two notable exceptions
        use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a puck) with a hole in the center instead. The first
        case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam
        Jacks. The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s to make a related game
        that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. The
        floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true variant due to the fact that it was
        designed in the 1990s and modelled off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in
        Canada in 1963.</div>

        <h1>4.Kabaddi</h1>
    </i>
    <div>Kabaddi (/kəˈbædi/,[2] /ˈkʌbədi/)[3] is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players,
        originating in ancient India.[4] The objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a
        "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of their players as possible, and
        return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. Points are
        scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider.
        Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but return to the game after each point scored
        by their team from a tag or tackle.

        It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi
        appear in the histories of India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the
        national sport of Bangladesh.[5] It is the second most popular and viewed sport in India after cricket.[4][6] It
        is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala,
        Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.[7]

        There are two major disciplines: "Punjabi kabaddi", also called "circle style", comprises traditional forms of
        the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, and the "standard style", on a rectangular court
        indoors, is played in major professional leagues and international competitions such as the Asian Games.</div>

        <h1>5.Kho Kho</h1>
    </i>
    <div>Kho kho is a traditional South Asian sport that dates to ancient India.[1][2] It is the second-most popular
        traditional tag game in the Indian subcontinent after kabaddi.[3] Kho kho is played on a rectangular court with
        a central lane connecting two poles which are at either end of the court. During the game, nine players from the
        chasing team (attacking team) are on the field, with eight of them sitting (crouched) in the central lane, while
        three runners from the defending team run around the court and try to avoid being touched.[2] Each sitting
        player on the chasing team faces the opposite half of the field that their adjacent teammates are facing.

        At any time, one player from the chasing team (the 'active chaser'/'attacker') may run around the court to
        attempt to tag (touch) members of the defending team, with one point scored per tag, and each tagged defender
        required to leave the field; however, the active chaser cannot cross the central lane to access the other half
        of the field, and cannot change direction once they start running toward either pole. The chasing team can get
        around these restrictions if the active chaser either switches roles with a sitting teammate (by touching them
        on the back while saying "Kho") who is facing the other half of the court and therefore has access to it, or
        runs to the area behind either pole and then switches direction/half. Each team has two turns to score and two
        turns to defend, with each turn lasting nine minutes</div>
