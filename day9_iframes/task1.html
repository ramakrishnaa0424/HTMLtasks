        <p>This flavorful and highly nutritious national dish of India is especially popular in southern parts of the
            country, but it can also be found in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Dal is a stew with the main
            ingredient of black or yellow lentils—the most consumed ingredients in India—but it can also be pared
            with peas, chickpeas, or mung beans.

            Inexpensive and easy to make, dal was an ideal food for the working class as it provided lots of energy for
            a full day of labor. While yellow lentils are most commonly used, black lentils are the most prized variety
            when making dal. Hulled and split, the slightly nutty lentils are slowly simmered with a variety of spices
            such as caraway, coriander, onions, garlic, chiles, and ginger until they break apart, and are then mashed
            into a smooth purée. </p>
